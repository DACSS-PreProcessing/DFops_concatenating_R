    "# Concatenating Data Frames in R\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenating is an operation at the data frame level. It is an easy\n",
    "operation when all the data frames have the **same** column names, and\n",
    "in the same position (vertical concatenation).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, there is a webpage in **fragilestatesindex.org** where\n",
    "we can find several links to excel files. Let me get all the links:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` r\n",
    "library(rvest) \n",
    "  \n",
    "# Read the HTML content of the website \n",
    "webpage <- read_html(\"https://fragilestatesindex.org/excel/\") \n",

    " \n",
    "allLinks=html_nodes(webpage,\"table\") %>%\n",
    "            html_nodes(\"a\") %>% #“a” nodes contain linked text.\n",
    "                html_attr(\"href\")%>% # the url (an html attribute)\n",
    "                    trimws()%>%unique() # cleaning and keeping non duplicated\n",
    "allLinks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I will create a list of data frames by loading the data from those\n",

    "\n",
    "We can solve this. Let’s build a list where each element is the column\n",

    "\n",
    "``` r\n",
    "Reduce(intersect, allNames)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is the union of all the column names:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` r\n",
    "Reduce(union, allNames)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what is NOT common:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` r\n",
    "setdiff(Reduce(union, allNames),Reduce(intersect, allNames))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I will force that each DF has the same names and in the same position:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` r\n",
    "allInCommon=Reduce(intersect, allNames)\n",
    "\n",
    "for (i in 1:length(dfs)){\n",
